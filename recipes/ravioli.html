        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</p>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Heat a skillet over medium high heat. Cook and stir sausage in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, breaking up large pieces with a wooden spoon, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain fat from the skillet.</p>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Pour marinara sauce into the skillet, and stir to combine with sausage. Turn off heat.</p>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>Stir cottage cheese, softened cream cheese, yogurt, Parmesan cheese, parsley, and granulated garlic together in a large bowl. Add cheese ravioli to the bowl and toss together until all ravioli are coated with cheese mixture.</p>
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p>Spread the ravioli mixture evenly in the baking dish. Pour meat sauce over ravioli and spread evenly. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese evenly on top.</p>
        <h3>Step 6</h3>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is golden brown, about 45 minutes. Remove from the oven; rest about 10 minutes before serving. Sprinkle with thinly sliced basil.</p>
