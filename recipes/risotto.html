            <li>1 ½ cups Arborio rice</li>
            <li>½ cup dry white wine</li>

        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Warm broth in a saucepan over low heat. Meanwhile, warm 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add portobello and white mushrooms; cook and stir until soft, about 3 minutes. Remove mushrooms and their liquid to a bowl; set aside.</p>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Add remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil to the saucepan. Stir in shallots and cook for 1 minute. Add rice; cook and stir until rice is coated with oil and pale, golden in color, about 2 minutes.</p>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Pour in wine, stirring constantly until wine is fully absorbed. Add 1/2 cup warm broth to the rice, and stir until the broth is absorbed.</p>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>Continue adding broth, 1/2 cup at a time, stirring constantly, until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender, yet firm to the bite, about 15 to 20 minutes.</p>
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p>Remove from heat. Stir in reserved mushrooms and their liquid, butter, chives, and Parmesan cheese.</p>
        <h3>Step 6</h3>
        <p>Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.</p>
